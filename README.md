In this project, we used the Cuckoo Search Optimization algorithm to find the optimal path in a non-oriented graph to go from node x to node y. Follow the instructions in the README file to install both the web application and the Python implementation of the algorithm. The algorithm implementation utilizes threads for ensure efficiency.
